# i AM Laura N. Sotomayor 🤠
## 🌏 Geospatial Computer Scientist & Remote Sensing in Ecosystems

🛸 PhD student in Geomatic Engineering at the University of Tasmania (UTAS) in Australia. 
```diff
👩🏻‍💻 Researching on Deep Learning-based Computer Vision Applications 
  --> for Remote Sensing-based Ecosystem Monitoring.
🛰️ Drone platforms (RGB | LiDAR | Multispectral | Hyperspectral) for collecting high-resolution imagery data.
🍃 Achieve precise representation of ecosystem
     -composition (i.e., ecological variables), 
     -structure (i.e., biophysical variables), and 
     -function (i.e., biochemical variables) features 
  --> by integrating advanced remote sensing technologies and applying state-of-art deep learning methods,
      with a particular emphasis on diverse semi-arid terrestrial ecosystems in Australia.
